abstract = {This paper is concerned with long time numerical behaviors of nonlinear fractional pantograph equations. The L1 method with the linear interpolation procedure is applied to solve these nonlinear problems. It is proved that the proposed numerical scheme can inherit the long time behavior of the underlying problems without any stepsize restrictions. After that, the fast evaluation is presented to speed up the calculation of the Caputo fractional derivative. Numerical examples are shown to confirm the theoretical results. Besides, several counter-examples are also given to show that not all the numerical methods can inherit the long time behavior of the underlying problems.}

abstract = {This article deals with the existence of solutions of nonlinear fractional pantograph equations. Such model can be considered suitable to be applied when the corresponding process occurs through strongly anomalous media. The results are obtained using fractional calculus and fixed point theorems. An example is provided to illustrate the main result obtained in this article.}
